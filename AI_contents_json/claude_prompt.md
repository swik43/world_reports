Here is the updated prompt incorporating all your amendments:

---

I will provide you with the contents pages from an Amnesty International annual report PDF. Extract every country name and its page number as listed.
Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact format — no commentary:

```
{
  "FILENAME.pdf": [
    { "name": "Afghanistan", "report_page": 50 },
    { "name": "Albania", "report_page": 54 }
  ]
}
```

Rules:
* Use the country name exactly as printed, converted to Title Case
* "report_page" is the page number shown next to the country name in the contents
* Only include country entries — skip headers like "Foreword", "Regional Overview", "Preface", "Abbreviations", etc.
* Maintain the order as listed in the contents
* If multiple columns, read the columns top-to-bottom, left-to-right
* I will provide the filename prefix each time. Append `_Amnesty_International.pdf` to the prefix unless the prefix already contains `_Amnesty_International`, in which case just append `.pdf`
